Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Project title: Smart Hiking Jacket 

* Team members: 
David Song, Trinity Donohugh, Harry Moran

* Description (1 pp describing the basic idea)
We are planning to create a hiking jacket with LED lights that change based on the hiker's altitude levels. We came up with this idea because we are all really into exercise and sports and were thinking of how technology can be used as an incentive to work harder. The goal of the LED lights changing based on altitude is to motivate the hiker to continue upwards since the LEDs can show how far up the hiker is.

* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need)
LED light stripes (change into multi-colours)
Pedometer
Altimeter 
Accelerometer 
Photoresistor 
Microphone 
Power source
Lightweight jacket

* Funds requested (the amount you will want to be reimbursed, remember you have
  a $20 budget per person)
not sure yet -- will figure out on Friday (March 8)

* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task
Trinity -- processing altimeter data 
Harry -- configuration of LEDs
David -- interfacing altimeter and LEDs

* Goals for next week
1. get parts ordered 
2. figure out how to convert measurements from the altimeter to work with our GPIO inputs and outputs.

Keep the proposal short and to the point.

We suggest you try to get all the major hardware components working by the
first week. That will leave the following week for putting the components
together into a working system.
