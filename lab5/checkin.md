title: 'Lab 5: Check-in'
---

During lab, we encourage you to check your understanding with a TA
after completing a section or two, while the material is still fresh
in your mind.

Each question below is a diagnostic question for each section of the
lab. Try answering one after finishing each section to test your
understanding.

1. What frequency is the PS/2 clock running at? (This is for section 2.)

2. What sequence of codes is required to type `A`?

3. In a PS/2 scancode, does the least significant or most significant bit arrive first?

4. Show off the scancodes received by your working implementation of `keyboard_read_scancode`.

Before leaving the lab, check in with a TA and discuss any challenges
to answering the questions in the lab. If you do not feel confident
about your responses, please ask us about it too!
